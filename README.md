# 5. Next Steps / Ice-Box Items: 

Idea for next phases of development:

- CRUD functionality in the reviews.
- I want the user to be able to have a search bar for the items.  
- I want the user to be able to post and sell their items. 
- I want my user to have a wishlist.
- I want my user to get reward points for the reviews.
